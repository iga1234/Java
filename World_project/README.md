Implement the world in Java using object-oriented programming concepts available in Java and apply at least two design patterns (e.g., Factory, Observer, Visitor, etc.).

Add a new organism, the Alien, to the world. The Alien moves one square like a king in chess. The Alien is invisible to other organisms. Its presence on a given square causes time to "freeze" within a two-square radius. The Alien appears and disappears spontaneously.

Balance the rules governing the world so that no species becomes extinct and that no single species dominates the world.

Equip the program with tests that verify interactions between organisms.

The program should have an interface (textual or graphical) allowing observation of the worldâ€™s development over successive turns.
